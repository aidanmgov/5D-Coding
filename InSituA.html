			History:
		</div>
		<div class="info-text">
			Pyrex first began releasing its products to the public beginning in 1915.

			The measuring cup, primarily used for measuring desired amounts of food or liquid needed for cooking, evolved and changed forms through different iterations of the product.

			The most notable change made to the cup came with an alteration of the handle.
		</div>
		<div class="category-text">
			Affordances:
		</div>
		<div class="info-text">
			The cup’s handle affords the user the ability to grasp and maneuver the object throughout whatever range of motion is necessary to control the food or liquid.

			The cup affords visibility through its glass material. The user has full visibility of the cup’s contents.

			The cup is made of glass, which affords exposure to heat without the problems associated with plastic alternatives.

			The cup also affords drinking as it can be used as a traditional drinking glass, just with an attached handle.
		</div>
		<div class="category-text">
			Constraints:
		</div>
		<div class="info-text">
			A physical constraint posed by the old handle is a restriction of grip created by the small space between the handle’s two points of attachment to the side of the cup.

			While the commonly-perceived way of using the cup may be to grasp it while filling it with food or liquid needed for cooking, perhaps cultural differences in cooking methods could change the way people look at the object.
